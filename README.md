Tchisla is a math puzzle to make a target number with only one kind of digits,
operators +, -, \*, /, ^, !, √, and parentheses.  The fewer the digits, the
higher the score.

This software finds an answer with the fewest digits.  The operator √ is
precedent to ! because factorials from 2! on are no perfect squares.
